### ⚙️ Architecture Highlights

* EVM-Compatible Layer 2: ChainBase is a PHP-native blockchain that replicates Ethereum's EVM behavior for seamless interoperability.
* Gasless Transactions: Player-to-player interactions (like trading items or voting) can be made gasless, making gameplay feel seamless and fast.
* Selective Gas Usage: Only transactions with economic weight (e.g., NFT marketplace listings, cross-chain bridges, or token staking) incur small fees, maintaining network sustainability while preserving UX.
* Smart Contracts via PHP: Contracts are parsed and executed using a PHP VM. This provides full transparency and a familiar environment for PHP, Solidity and Other developers.

### 🎮 Use Case Examples

* In-Game Item Trading: Trade inventory between players gaslessly via peer-signed transactions.
* NFT Marketplace: Listing or purchasing rare items uses gas (very low fees) to register trades on-chain.
